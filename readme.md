Dan's Laravel Testing App
=========================
I'm building this as an exploration of Laravel.  My endpoint goal at this time is to make it into a simple CMS, just to grasp many of the primary concepts of developing with Laravel.  I'll implement the following goals as I proceed:
* Authentication with CSRF protection
* Differentiate user groups (admin, poster, guest)
* Post model to allow users to post pages to the front-end
* User accounts management 
* Edit your own password (not other users passwords)
* Public facing registration form which requires approval of an admin
* Add new user form accessible only to admins
After I make it this far, my goals and ideas for this project will have grown.  These seem like necessary components of any CMS though.  

This project is built with:
## Laravel PHP Framework

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
